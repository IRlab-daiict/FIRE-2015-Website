<h2>Short Paper</h2>
<br>
<p>
We invite short papers (4 pages) describing work on any topic related to Information Retrieval and its evaluation. Specially welcome are the papers on creation of standard test collections on any sub-domain in the broad area of information access. Submitted papers will be blind-reviewed according to originality and technical merit. Selected papers will be published in the Workshop Proceedings in ACM Digital Library and can be presented during the Workshop. Authors of selected short papers will be invited to submit an extended version for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.
